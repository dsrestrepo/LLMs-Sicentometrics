Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.\",\n          \"Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being specifically trained in the task in question, causing excitement and concern about their use in healthcare settings.

Here we outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with impressive but mixed results.
